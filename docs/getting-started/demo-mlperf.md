# MLPerf benchmark demo

We collaborate with the [MLPerf benchmarking consortium](https://mlperf.org)
to automate the manual and tedious process of creating MLPerf inference 
benchmarks and submitting results.

We have prepared a demo of the open-source CodeReef solution 
for the object detection application from the MLPerf inference benchmark 
based on SSD-Mobilenets, TensorFlow and COCO data-set: 
[CodeReef.ai/demo](https://CodeReef.ai/demo).

Please follow the instructions from above page to install the open-source CodeReef Client 
with the unified CodeReef API to automatically build, run and validate 
this solution on your machine.

You should be able to reproduce some of the latest 
[MLPerf inference benchmark results](https://mlperf.org/inference-results)
from this [research paper](https://dev.codereef.ai/portal/c/cr-lib/d0e50ebb5b9d4ec9)
and compare your results against the official ones using 
this [CodeReef dashboard](https://dev.codereef.ai/portal/c/cr-result/sota-mlperf-object-detection-v0.5-crowd-benchmarking).

You may be interested to check the [CodeReef meta information](https://dev.codereef.ai/portal/c/cr-solution/demo-obj-detection-coco-tf-cpu-benchmark-linux-portable-workflows/#digital-artifact) 
for this solution including [stable dependencies](https://dev.codereef.ai/portal/c/cr-solution/demo-obj-detection-coco-tf-cpu-benchmark-linux-portable-workflows/#dependencies).
